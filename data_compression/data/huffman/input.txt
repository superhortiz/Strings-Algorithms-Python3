Huffman compression is a popular method used to compress data efficiently. It's a type of lossless data compression, meaning no information is lost during the compression process. Here's a brief overview:

How Huffman Compression Works
Frequency Analysis: The process starts with analyzing the frequency of each character or symbol in the data. Frequently occurring characters will be assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters get longer codes.

Building the Huffman Tree:

A binary tree (Huffman tree) is constructed based on the frequency of each character.

Each character is represented as a leaf node, with the frequency as its weight.

Nodes are combined in ascending order of their frequencies to form a binary tree. The two nodes with the smallest frequencies are combined first to create a new node with a combined frequency.

This process continues until there is only one node left, which becomes the root of the tree.

Generating Huffman Codes:

Each path from the root to a leaf node in the Huffman tree represents a unique binary code for the corresponding character.

Typically, moving left down the tree represents a '0', and moving right represents a '1'. Hence, each character gets a binary code based on its position in the tree.

Encoding: The original data is replaced with these binary codes to create the compressed data. Since more frequent characters have shorter codes, the overall size of the compressed data is reduced.

Decoding: To decompress the data, the Huffman tree is used to decode the binary codes back into the original characters.

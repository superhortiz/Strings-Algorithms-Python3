LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression is a lossless data compression algorithm. It is widely used in various applications, such as the GIF image format and TIFF files. Here's a detailed look at how LZW compression works:

How LZW Compression Works
Initialization:

Begin with an initial dictionary containing all possible single-character sequences (typically ASCII characters, which range from 0 to 255).

Encoding:

Read the input data character by character.

Start with an empty string (w).

For each character read, concatenate it with w to form a new string (w+c).

Check if w+c exists in the dictionary:

If it does, set w to w+c.

If it does not, add w+c to the dictionary and output the code for w. Then set w to the current character (c).

Repeat this process until all input characters are processed.

Output the code for the last w after the loop ends.

Dictionary Growth:

The dictionary grows dynamically as new sequences are added. The new sequences consist of longer strings as the compression progresses.
